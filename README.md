# mgl_switch
![PCB layout](pcbLayout.png)
This is a replacement switch for the Game Boy Light. The original MGL switch is an unusual 3PDT for which a suitable replacement isn't currently known. This design uses a standard 3PST switch and mosfets to replicate the ability to turn on the system and back light with a single switch.
